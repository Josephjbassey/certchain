## Video Structure

### Opening (30 seconds)

**[VISUAL: CertChain logo/landing page]**

**SCRIPT:**
> "Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to present CertChain - a decentralized certificate verification platform built on Hedera Hashgraph for the Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025."

**[VISUAL: Show problem statistics on screen]**

> "Did you know that credential fraud costs African institutions millions annually? And employers spend countless hours manually verifying certificates, often with no guarantee of authenticity."

> "CertChain solves this by issuing tamper-proof certificates as NFTs on Hedera, enabling instant verification for anyone, anywhere."

---

### Problem Statement (45 seconds)

**[VISUAL: Split screen showing traditional vs modern verification]**

**SCRIPT:**
> "Traditional certificate systems have four major problems:"

**[VISUAL: Animate each point]**
1. **Fraud** - "Paper certificates are easily forged"
2. **Manual verification** - "Slow, expensive, and unreliable"
3. **Centralized control** - "Vulnerable to data breaches and tampering"
4. **No ownership** - "Certificate holders don't truly own their credentials"

> "This is especially critical in Africa, where cross-border education and employment require trusted, instant verification."

---

### Solution Overview (45 seconds)

**[VISUAL: CertChain architecture diagram]**

**SCRIPT:**
> "CertChain leverages three core Hedera services to create a production-ready solution:"

**[VISUAL: Highlight each service]**

1. **HTS (Hedera Token Service)**
   > "We issue each certificate as a unique NFT in our collection. The token ID is 0.0.7115182 on testnet."

2. **HCS (Hedera Consensus Service)**
   > "Every action - issuance, claim, verification - is logged to our HCS topic for an immutable audit trail. Topic ID: 0.0.7115183"

3. **Hedera DID SDK**
   > "Each institution and certificate holder gets a decentralized identifier, enabling self-sovereign identity."

> "Plus, we store certificate metadata on IPFS for decentralized, permanent storage."

---

### Live Demo - Part 1: Institution Issues Certificate (90 seconds)

**[VISUAL: Screen recording - Login as institution]**

**SCRIPT:**

**[VISUAL: Show verification results]**

> "And immediately, they see:"
- ✅ Certificate is valid
- Student name and details
- Issuing institution
- Issue date
- Blockchain transaction proof
