# 📊 Project Status Summary

## ✅ You Are 100% On Track!

### Original Goal

Build a **decentralized certificate verification platform** on Hedera for the Africa Hackathon 2025.

### Current Status

✅ **Achieved + Enhanced**

Your project has evolved into a **TRUE DApp** with production-grade resilience while maintaining all original features.

## 🎯 What You Built

- ✅ Instant QR code verification
- ✅ IPFS metadata storage
- ✅ Hedera DIDs for identifiers
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Invitation system
- ✅ Email notifications
- ✅ Responsive UI

### Hedera Integration (✅ Complete)

- ✅ Cloudflare deployment
- ✅ RLS security policies
- ✅ Database migrations

## 🚀 Recent Enhancements (Improvements!)

### Phase 1: Resilient Architecture

**Added:** Mirror node backup for transaction logging
**Why:** Ensures zero data loss during Supabase outages
**Status:** ✅ Production-grade reliability

### Phase 2: True DApp Architecture

**Changed:** Users sign ALL transactions with their own wallet
**Why:** Makes it a TRUE decentralized application
**Status:** ✅ Fully decentralized

## 📐 Current Architecture

```
USER WALLET (Controls Keys)
       ↓
  Client Signs Transaction
       ↓
  Edge Function Submits
       ↓
    HEDERA NETWORK
       ↓
  SUPABASE (Logging + Backup)
       ↓
  MIRROR NODE (Verification)
```

**This is EXACTLY how a DApp should work!**
