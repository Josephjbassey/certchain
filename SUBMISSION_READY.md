## üí° Tips for Strong Submission

### Do's ‚úÖ
1. **Show, don't just tell** - Demo the working application
2. **Emphasize Hedera integration** - Show token on HashScan, topic messages
3. **Highlight impact** - Explain how it helps African education/employment
4. **Be specific** - Use real numbers, real transactions, real data
5. **Show blockchain proof** - Every feature should link to HashScan
6. **Explain the "why"** - Why Hedera? Why this approach?
7. **Be enthusiastic** - Show passion for solving the problem
8. **Keep it simple** - Focus on core value proposition

### Don'ts ‚ùå
1. **Don't use fake data** - All demos should be real blockchain transactions
2. **Don't skip the problem** - Judges need to understand why this matters
3. **Don't ignore Hedera** - This is a Hedera hackathon, emphasize integration
4. **Don't exceed time limits** - Keep video to 5-7 minutes
5. **Don't have poor audio** - Good audio quality is critical
6. **Don't forget mobile** - Show it works on phones
7. **Don't overlook documentation** - Judges will read your docs
8. **Don't submit late** - Test everything with time to spare

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If Verification Script Fails

**"Token not found":**
- Verify token ID in .env matches deployed token
- Check https://hashscan.io/testnet/token/0.0.7115182
- Ensure testnet is selected

**"Edge function not accessible":**
- Check Supabase dashboard
- Verify function is deployed
- Check secrets are configured
- Test with Supabase anon key

**"Build fails":**
- Run `npm install` or `bun install`
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Run `npm run lint` to find issues
- Check node version (need 18+)
