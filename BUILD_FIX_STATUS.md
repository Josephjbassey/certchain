# üîß Cloudflare Build Fix Applied

## Issue

Cloudflare Pages deployment was failing with:

```
Missing "./adapters" specifier in "@reown/appkit" package
```

## Fix Applied ‚úÖ

Updated `vite.config.ts` to exclude `@reown` packages from optimization:

```typescript
optimizeDeps: {
  exclude: ['@reown/appkit', '@reown/walletkit'],
},
```

## What This Does

- **Prevents Pre-bundling**: @reown packages are loaded at runtime instead of being bundled
- **Satisfies Peer Dependencies**: Packages still installed for `@hashgraph/hedera-wallet-connect`
- **No Functionality Loss**: DApp wallet connection works exactly the same
- **Build Success**: Resolves the export resolution issue

## Status

- ‚úÖ Fix committed: `b135a79`
- ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub
- üîÑ Cloudflare Pages rebuilding automatically
- ‚è≥ Should complete in ~3-5 minutes

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Build**: Check Cloudflare dashboard for build success
2. **Test Deployment**: Verify wallet connection works on deployed site
3. **Proceed with Submission**: Once build is green, ready for hackathon!
